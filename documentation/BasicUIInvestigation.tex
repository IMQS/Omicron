\section{Introduction}
Implementing a basic user interface our project we are investigating HTML 5 and JQuery,
\section{Hyper Text Markup Language}
HTML is a language for specifying the layout of websites, which we will be using to create our website . Its language is defined by using \verb+<``ELEMENT''>+ with a \verb+``ELEMENT''+ inside a set of angle brackets, this defines the begining of an environment while \verb+</``ELEMENT''>+ defines the end of the \verb+``ELEMENT''+'s environment. These environment specifiers are called ``tags'', HTML has a variaty of tags for many environments on a webpage, but it has 2 special tags, \verb+<div>+ and \verb+<script>+. The \verb+<script>+ is for executing a javascript on a webpage on the client-side while the \verb+<div>+ tag stands for dynamic, this dynamic element usually gets its properties from a piece of javascript executed on the webpage somewhere which adds a some dynamic content to the webpage such as user preferences and such.
\section{JavaScript}
JQuery is just a wrapper for javascript that simplifies the complicated UI features of javascript into several methods reducing the time it takes to code these UI effects so you can focus more on writing useful code for the implementation of your website. JavaScript can be used in HTML as well as other places these scripts are executed in the \verb+<script>+ environment of the HTML. This is used to make the pages more dynamic by storing user data such as cookies and user preferences as well as making async requests to other services such as what we will be doing.  

\section{Conclusion}
Since we will be implementing a basic UI we will be using HTML 5 and will not be using JQuery at this time. HTML and Simple javascript will be used in the implementation of the website for the basic interface.
