\section{Introduction}
Waze is an online real-time traffic monitor. This detects the speed of the vehicle and determines whether it is stuck in traffic by comparing the speed limit in the area. It allows you to communicate to fellow wazers and report traffic incidents, speed camera's, traffic jams and other such incidents that can take place on the roads.
\section{Use}
This application only has an android and iPhone application and has no REST calls in the websites API, it is still under development. Therefore this social application will be unable to allow the retrieval of geo-spacial data.
